# Adventure-Works-Discovery
Adventure Works is a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories. The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performances, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. To support the same, the following tables have been considered.
1. Calendar
2. Customer
3. Product Categories
4. Product Subcategories
5. Product
6. Territory
7. Sales
8. Returns<br>

This project employs the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields and measures, and designing an interactive report.
### Key Findings:
1. An increase by 3.31% has been observed in the monthly revenue, with a decrease in returns by 1.78%. The monthly orders, however, also shows a decrease by 0.88%.
2. The most ordered and returned product types are Tires and Tubes, and Shorts, respectively.
3. Accessories account for the maximum orders among other categories, with products such as Water Bottle - 30 oz. having the highest orders, and Sport-100 Helmet (Red and Blue) having the highest return rate.
4. Despite having the maximum orders, Water Bottle - 30 oz. fails to meet its current month's target for all - orders, revenue, and profit.
5. The United States gets the most orders, followed by Australia.
6. The total number of customers and the revenue per customer witness a rising and declining trend, respectively.
